I generated this piece with live coding. I created the keyboard function first and then built the others off of it. I wanted to start with a soft xylophone/piano sound and gradually have other layers of sound fill in. It took a lot of attempts and failures to find something that flowed, and I only made one melody that I was really proud of. 

In the future I'd consider random generation of chords that tend to flow well together, but I'd want to figure out the mathmatical relations there and create a formula that the notes would be generated from within in relation to the last note. I tried something similar to this, but wasn't pleased with the generation.
